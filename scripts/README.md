# Scripts folder

This folder can contains any script that you want to personal insert in this project without commiting and pushing to github (extensions ignored: .js, .ts, .py and .sh )

If you declare special module named `scrapper.py` with `def change_parser_categories(parser_name, parser_categories)` it will be passed the list of categories statements to change before saving (filter and group values).
